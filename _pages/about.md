  ### "You must understand the workings of the human mind or you are designing in the dark” - The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses, Jesse Schell
Researcher in the Computer Science department at the University of Helsinki, Finland. Background in psychology and cognitive science with a desire to apply that knowledge to games, particularly serious games.

# Philosophy and background:
## Why I want to make games
Knowing the brain, how it works and where the weak spots are allows you to place challenges exactly where you want to challenge players in specific ways.
<br>
Cognitive science, being the study of perception, memory, attention, learning, reasoning and problem solving, is extremely relevant because all of those neurological processes are involved as players are playing the games. 

Further, as education moves more and more towards digitalization (and in some cases gamification),

### Fighting bad science
There has also been an explosion in what is called pop psychology and pop neuroscience, and these spread ill-informed myths across many fields, on of which is game design.
One does not have to look far to find games "based on neuroscience and boost your brain!". However, when research has been done into these games and systems, it is difficult to determine what benefit (if any) is derived from the system, and what is simply the placebo effect. Either way, the games are not nearly as effective as they suggest they are.
This has also

People just replace words like focus with the meditation buzzwords to make it trendy and zen 
For letter of motivation or description of game in portfolio: “But we need to fight this with evidence based blah"

# Current projects:
<br>
## Title TBD: Neurogame
**An ongoing project attempting to integrate a tower-defense game and a quiz game, branching the fields of video games and psychology/cognitive science by providing short lessons on these topics and their role in video games**
<br>
## Title TBD: Attention-cultivating game
**An ongoing project attempting to provide a brief meditative break by providing haptic feedback**
Could call the games I am making as models for theoretical tests or something.. blah blah for future experiments



Education is moving more towards digitalization and gamification is a part of that 
“Another source of inspiration is due to my background in Eastern philosophy and meditation. As a long-time meditator and an educator, the potential for video games to mass distribute methods for people to become more grateful, contemplative and content drives me to expand and innovate in this field."



My previous experience in physiological equipment will be useful when neurogaming and related fields become increasingly common (Adam Gazzaley)
