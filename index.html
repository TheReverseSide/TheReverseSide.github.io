        <p>
          <font color="silver">
            Currently I conduct research in the realm of Human-Computer Interaction, drawing upon user psychology and user research to optimize user experience. My background is in psychology and cognitive science, having studied many of the
            branches of cognitive science, including anthropology, artificial intelligence and philosophy.
            <br> <br>
            Since I have always been interested in human behavior as well, as soon as I realized that there is so much overlap between my professional academic interests and one of my lifelong hobbies – video games - I completely dedicated myself to
            studying and working in this fascinating area.
            <br> <br>
            I am extremely passionate about this topic because I firmly believe in the potential of games to provide actual benefit whether by psychological benefits like in serious games, or by just having fun and improving our day.

      <h1 class="display-2">WHY I MAKE GAMES</h1>
      <p>
        <font size="4" font color="silver" line-height="1">
          For my entire life I have been a gamer and someone who enjoys creative work, whether that be designing worlds in game scenario editors or actually drawing concept art. I started gaming fairly young and never stopped, because something
          about the medium connected with me.
          <br>
          <br>
          I think there is enormous potential in games to not just entertain and but provide tangible benefits in people’s lives. With thoughtful choices paired with knowledge of human cognition, we can elicit experiences in people and therefore
          change their cognition. This has huge implications beyond the entertainment industry and becomes a means of effecting large numbers of people.
          <br>
          <br>
          In a similar vein, the neurogame industry (continually adapting games that use user physiological data), is gradually gaining steam. Researchers such as Adam Gazzaley will surely continue their work, and having experience with
          physiological signals myself, I greatly look forward to these projects becoming more popular and accessible.
          <br>
          <br>
          Another source of inspiration is due to my background in Eastern philosophy and meditation. As a long-time meditator, the potential for video games to mass distribute methods for people to become more grateful, contemplative and content
          drives me to expand and innovate in this field.

      <p>
        <font size="4" font color="silver" line-height="1">
          Cognitive science, the study of perception, attention, learning, reasoning and problem solving, is extremely relevant because all of those processes are involved as players are engaged in games.
          <br><br>
          Knowing the brain, how it works and where the weak spots are allows designers to place challenges exactly where they want, to challenge players in specific ways and to promote certain types of experiences, while avoiding the unwanted ones.
          <br>
          <br>
          “Can we” versus “should we” - However, current events show that this industry suffers from a lack of respect and caustic treatment of its consumers, with immediate financial gains being placed before value to the user. Since some
          psychologists are being used for this
          purpose, I feel frustrated and motivated enough to want to actively go forward with the intention of showing other uses for psychologists than simply manipulating users into forking over their money for useless in-game items. This is an
          important topic for me and one that I will continue to pursue.

        <font size="4" font color="silver" line-height="1">
          As a part-time educator - teaching English and Spanish and tutoring psychology and philosophy - it is easy to see that the method by which the lessons and information are presented to the learner are as important, if not more so, than the
          lessons themselves. As education moves more towards digitalization, a deep understanding of how the brain interacts with this digital media is becoming more important.
          <br><br>
          This points towards video games, as they are one of the most engaging electronic mediums, providing immediate, effective feedback. Both gamified learning experiences and educational games are being implemented more frequently with
          promising results. For example, I admire Psyon games and how they make the science and education fun and accessible, particularly the game Antidote which partly inspired one of my projects.
          <br><br>
          The recent growth in this nascent field presents an opportunity to play a role in an exciting paradigm shift in education, providing an engaging learning experience that tailors to the individual, and learns both about them and with them.

How to show off game projects
Use your background to explain why you selected certain things in your game design
I should be able to reach your resume in just one click.
I should be able to quickly find all of your major portfolio work from your main page.
I should have a good idea of how many portfolio pieces you have. Before navigating to one of your projects, I should have an idea of whether it’s 2D or 3D, and/or what engine it was created in
Next, you should summarize the piece and tell me why it’s important. This is a brief (1-2 sentence) explanation of the gameplay and highlighting one element – is it the complex scripting? The level of polish? The boss battle? The combat design? The puzzles? This summary should focus on the GAMEPLAY. I want to know what kind of design work it entailed.
Screenshots that show off the gameplay. Taking pictures of gameplay can be hard, but it’s important. Make each screenshot show off something different in the game, rather than several angles of the same thing.
A video walkthrough of the game or level. Make sure you use a simple format (like embedding it as a YouTube video), and that it is not auto-playing. Trailers for a game also work well, but the point of this is to show off gameplay, not sell a product.
Written details on the gameplay, how you implemented it, what your goals and challenges were. You should be specific, clear, and talk about one part of gameplay in depth rather than trying to explain all of it – this is where I get an idea of how you think and whether you understand good design and game development. Again, this doesn’t need to be long – a paragraph may be enough, depending on how much detail you want to go into.
Any 2D maps, or overhead screenshots with overlay diagrams, identifying key gameplay elements like the critical path or pickups or interactive elements.
Design documentation you’ve written for projects. These could be level design docs, quest designs, game design ‘bibles’, systems balancing excel sheets, flowcharts, or similar. Please do not include any giant 50-page beasts – no one is impressed by the length. Short, concise and actionable documentation is great to see, as are visualizations of game design flow. If all you have are giant unwieldy documents, then I would skip this.
Your design work should be the most important thing on your website.
Give me a single page with all the information about the project & Clearly label it with the following information:
If you were the only person, or if you had help / it was a created by a team
Any downloadable files and instructions on how to use them, if necessary (note: if it’s a map or mod of an existing game, chances are no one will play it, but even then I’d like to see it as an option).
Include two or three sentences about your creative process for each thing in your portfolio, and maybe any unique challenges you had to overcome.
Mention how many unique sounds I have put in

                  This game is an ongoing project to branch the fields of video games and psychology/cognitive science by providing short lessons on these topics and their role in video games. I don’t think understanding human behavior gets the
                  respect it deserves in the realm of games, considering the amount of aspects in games that are influenced by "human factors”. Therefore, I hope to inspire in the gamer an interest and appreciation in human behavior and cognition
                  that
                  they may not have had before.
                  <br> <br>
                  The game itself consists of brief lessons regarding each of the brain regions, its role and how this is influential in games. After the lesson, there is a quiz that offers players a chance to be rewarded for understanding the
                  material. If a question is incorrect, the correct answer is displayed along with an explanation as to why. For each correct question answered, the player receives a reward of 1) the energy-currency Glucose to be spent on turrets
                  and upgrades and 2) cards which are used to upgrade turrets, exchange for glucose, or upgrade glial cells.
                  <br> <br>
                  The player reviews how many questions were answered correctly, etc, then moves to the combat phase where they must defend the neural connections in their own brain to save themselves. <br>

                  The game was made entirely myself over a period of several months before/after work, lunchbreaks, and on weekends. It has been a huge amount of work but a labor of love.
                  <br><br>
                  Since I am partially self-taught, the process basically consisted of me writing out my vision with a few designs in mind, drawing several prototypes, and iteratively improving until reaching a point to begin the actual coding.
                  <br><br>
                  I have had several game ideas in the past, but this was the first time I ever actually implemented something. I wanted to make an educational game years ago, had done all the research, but did not have the coding ability to
                  carry
                  it out.
                  <br><br>
                  There is a short gameplay video available on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jt5L-dwrgo&">Youtube channel</a> to get an idea of the flow of the game.

                  <br><br>
                  *An idea that did not make it into the game (perhaps another) involves connecting and disconnecting the synapses to form a path for the enemies – perhaps depending
                  on neuro-health marker (quiz score?). However, for this game I wanted the player to have the choice about which parts they play.

                  I chose tower defense because it provided a good framework upon which I could place quiz rounds and a logical way to progress the difficulty. Further, the continual accumulation of resources in TD
                  games allowed me to easily provide rewards for correctly answering questions.

                  All 6 brain areas must be cleared, with 4 stages per area. Each stage gets progressively more difficult, occuring deeper in the brain, bringing visual changes and more complex neural pathways that the invading bacteria
                  can take.
                  <br><br>
                  There are several other features that will be expanded on including: barriers, economy management, point system, card system, and varying complexity.

                  At the end of each neuron, there is a glucose producing cell which produces a small stream of glucose for the player. <br>

                  There are two parts: 1) during gameplay, there is a bar from 0-100, representing how much the infection has entered deeper into the brain. At 100, that stage has been lost.<br><br>
                  The second component is present through the entire game and acts as a 6 x 4 grid system (6 brain areas and 4 stages per area). Once a row or column is filled with a certain performance level, the player
                  receives a reward.<br><br>
                  For example, by completing all 4 stages of the occipital lobe with 0% infection level grants a big reward and the player is notified that their visual acuity has increased by 20%.

                  The game was made with Unity, with scripts written in C#. I chose not to use a visual scripting asset in order to more deeply understand the game code.
                  <br><br>
                  I have made several small games - simple things to understand the mechanics, and even a rudimentary tower defense game, but this was by far the largest project that I have ever worked on and going from a few hundred lines of code
                  to several thousand proved challenging but ultimately extremely rewarding both for pleasure and enhancing skills.
                  <br><br>
                  Assets were used for things that I was not able to do myself: turret models, spline and shader scripts, game audio, etc.

                    Glial cells, protective and supporting cells, are a large part of this game and a major distinguishing factor in what I think makes this game unique. <br><br>

                    All slots for turrets are available from the start, however, they are myelin sheaths which do not provide any benefit. Players can use the cards to select from a variety of glial cells, providing unique effects and bonuses. Glial
                    cells are not able to be bought, only earned – one must learn and
                    understand the material to be able to master and beat the game. <br><br>

                    By combining certain glial cells and certain turrets, unique combinations are able to be made to more effectively counter enemy types. <br><br>

                    Cards are given for performing well in quizzes (including a streak bonus) that grants the player cards of: glial cells, turrets, or glucose. <br> <br>

                  A calm, contemplative music-based game. <br> <br>

                  Where the Birds Are is a game created during the Finnish Global Game Jam of 2019. <br>
                  The theme was “the feeling associated with your home” - Since we are in Finland, the natural choice was a forest-based game. <br>
                  Gameplay of our game can be found on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0vagMRrB9M">Youtube</a>.

                  Originally designed to be a highly narrative based, contemplative game which gradually reveals changes throughout the lifetime of the forest, through team ideation it gradually turned into a music-based game built around placing
                  birdhouses, retaining the contemplative spirit. <br> <br>
                  Our team intended to create a wonderful audio ambient environment that grows in complexity and beauty as the player continues to progress. The visuals were meant to be low-poly complemented by nice lighting and fog effects to give
                  the sense of a deep forest.<br> <br>
                  Something very important for our game is the synchronization of sounds: the sounds are triggered at the exact moment the birdhouse is placed, and mixes seamlessly with the existing music in the game. <br>

                  The game conists of three stages, intially giving the player a handful of trees upon which to place birdhouses. As the game progresses, the camera pans out and more of the forest is revealed to the player.<br>
                  <br>
                  The birdhouses are divided in two colors, and although there is no explicit purpose of the game, the player can see and hear a connection form if two birdhouses of the same color are placed on the same height level facing each
                  other. <br> <br>
                  Upon placement, the ambient music is expanded upon from 24 sounds, all created during the jam. As the number of birdhouses increases, so does the complexity of the music. As the camera pans out, the player also begins to see
                  other NPCs, all forming a community, with the implication that this is home for not only the birds, but also the players. <br> <br>

  <!--Fighting bad science
    There has also been an explosion in what is called pop psychology and pop neuroscience, and these spread ill-informed myths across many fields, on of which is game design.
    One does not have to look far to find games "based on neuroscience and boost your brain!". However, when research has been done into these games and systems, it is difficult to determine what benefit (if any) is derived from the system, and what is simply the placebo effect. Either way, the games are not nearly as effective as they suggest they are.
    People just replace words like focus with the meditation buzzwords to make it trendy and zen
    For letter of motivation or description of game in portfolio: “But we need to fight this with evidence based blah"-->
